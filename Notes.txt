Mastering WebSockets With Go - An in-depth tutorial

WebSockets is one of the oldest ways to communicate in a bi-directional way and is widely used today.
It is supported by most browsers and is relatively easy to use. WebSockets are really useful when building real time apis.

In this tutorial, we will cover what WebSockets are and how they work, how to use them in Go to communicate between servers and clients.
We will also explore some regular pitfalls that I've seen in WebSocket APIs, and how to solve them.

During the tutorial, we will be building a chat application where you can enter different chat rooms.
The WebSocket server will be built using Go, and the client connecting in vanilla JavaScript.
The patterns we learn and apply could easily be adapted when connecting using a Websocket Client written in Go, Java, React, or any other language.

We will learn about Authentication, Heartbeats using Ping & Pong, Cross Origin and a number of other useful WebSocket related things.
